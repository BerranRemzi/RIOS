# RIOS

RIOS is a cooperative multitask scheduler written entirely in C
 - Is simple and understandable for the beginning embedded programmer
 - Can provide basic non-preemptive or preemptive cooperative multitasking capabilities for cooperative tasks
 - Requires only a few dozen lines of C code. Reduces need for RTOS (real-time operating system).

## About

RIOS stands for Riverside/Irvine Operating System, developed at the University of California (UC) Riverside and UC Irvine. RIOS is not really an operating system but rather a simple task scheduler, the key element of a real-time operating system in embedded systems.
